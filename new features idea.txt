Feature Ideas for Your GSMArena Data Scraper Project
Here are some exciting features we could add to enhance your application:

Data Analysis and Visualization
Device Comparison Tool: Allow users to select multiple devices and compare their specifications side by side.
Interactive Charts: Add charts to visualize trends like:
Phone releases by year
Screen size evolution over time
Battery capacity improvements
Camera megapixel progression
Brand Statistics Dashboard: Show statistics for each brand (average specs, most common features, etc.)
Search and Filter Capabilities
Advanced Search: Implement a powerful search feature that lets users find devices by specific criteria:
Processor type (e.g., "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2")
Camera specs (e.g., "48MP or higher")
RAM/Storage combinations
Battery capacity range
Spec-Based Filtering: Allow users to filter devices by specific requirements:
Screen size range
Battery capacity minimum
Camera quality threshold
Release year range
User Experience Improvements
Export Functionality: Add options to export data in different formats:
Excel/CSV for further analysis
PDF reports for sharing
JSON for API integration
Favorites/Bookmarks: Let users save devices they're interested in for quick access later.
Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Add a theme switcher to complement your current neon theme.
Mobile Responsive Design: Ensure the application works well on mobile devices.
Technical Enhancements
Incremental Updates: Instead of scraping everything again, add the ability to only scrape new devices since the last update.
Scheduled Scraping: Implement automatic scraping at scheduled intervals to keep data fresh.
Caching Improvements: Enhance caching to reduce load on GSMArena and improve performance.
API Endpoint: Create a simple REST API to allow other applications to access your device database.
Machine Learning Features
Price Prediction: Implement a ML model to predict device prices based on specifications.
Device Recommendation: Based on user preferences, recommend similar devices.
Spec Classification: Automatically classify devices into categories (budget, mid-range, flagship) based on specs.
